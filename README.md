# Apple Watch Weight App
*Apple Watch Weight App* is an iOS and watchOS app built for the purpose of displaying a person's weight. There are two components to this project, a software application and a hardware weight scale. The scale is currently in devleopment by engineering studens at FIU. The plan is to create a scale similar to the size of an Apple air-tag that can fit inside a users shoe. The device would then send data via bluetooth, for the weight application to collect and display via means of a graph.
